"Explain Mobiloitte's leave policy for employees.","Mobiloitte follows a comprehensive leave policy designed to balance employee well-being with business continuity. Full-time employees are eligible for a structured mix of leave types including Casual Leave (CL), Sick Leave (SL), and Earned/Privilege Leave (EL/PL) as specified in their appointment letter. The standard entitlement typically includes 12 days of Casual Leave, 12 days of Sick Leave, and 15-20 days of Earned Leave per calendar year, subject to role and tenure. All planned leaves must be applied in advance through the HRMS portal or attendance system and require approval from the reporting manager. Unplanned or emergency leaves (medical emergencies, family emergencies, or urgent personal situations) should be communicated to the manager and HR immediately via phone or email, followed by formal application within 48 hours. Leave applications can be tracked in real-time through the employee self-service portal. Unused Earned Leave can be carried forward to the next year (up to a maximum limit) or encashed as per company policy, while Casual Leave and Sick Leave typically lapse at the end of the calendar year if unused.","employee","HR Policy","leave policy,leaves,hr,employee benefits"
"What types of leaves are available (casual, sick, earned)?","Mobiloitte provides employees with multiple leave types to address different needs: 1) Casual Leave (CL) - Typically 12 days per year for short-term personal needs, family events, or minor emergencies. This leave does not require medical certificates and can be taken in half-day or full-day increments. 2) Sick Leave (SL) - Usually 12 days annually for illness, medical appointments, or health-related issues. Medical certificates may be required for leaves exceeding 3 consecutive days. 3) Earned/Privilege Leave (EL/PL) - Generally 15-20 days per year (accrued monthly) for planned vacations, longer personal commitments, or extended breaks. This leave accrues based on completed months of service and can be taken in blocks. 4) Maternity/Paternity Leave - As per statutory requirements (typically 26 weeks for maternity, 15 days for paternity). 5) Compensatory Off (Comp Off) - Granted for working on holidays or beyond standard hours, subject to manager approval. 6) Bereavement Leave - Usually 3-5 days for immediate family members. The exact entitlement varies by role, location, and employment terms. Unused Earned Leave can be carried forward (typically up to 30 days) or encashed, while Casual and Sick Leave lapse at year-end if unused.","employee","HR Policy","leave types,casual leave,sick leave,earned leave,privilege leave,maternity,paternity"
"What are the standard working hours and attendance rules?","Mobiloitte follows standard working hours typically from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (9 hours including a 1-hour lunch break) on working days, though specific timings may vary by project, client requirements, or location. Flexible working hours may be available for certain roles with prior manager approval. Employees are required to mark attendance daily using the prescribed system - biometric devices at office locations, or web portal/mobile app for remote/hybrid work. In-time and out-time must be recorded accurately. Late arrival beyond the grace period (typically 15 minutes) is considered late coming and may require manager approval or compensatory work. Early departure requires prior permission. Regular attendance is mandatory, and unapproved absences can result in salary deduction, performance impact, or disciplinary action. Work-from-home (WFH) arrangements are available subject to project requirements and manager approval, with attendance marked through the online portal. Shift allowances may apply for employees working in different time zones or night shifts. Attendance reports are accessible through the employee self-service portal, and discrepancies should be reported to HR within 48 hours.","employee","Attendance","working hours,attendance,shift,office timing,WFH,flexible hours"
"How does payroll processing and salary credit work?","Mobiloitte processes payroll on a monthly cycle with salary credit typically occurring on the last working day of each month (or the 1st of the following month) to the employee's registered bank account via NEFT/RTGS. The exact credit date may vary due to weekends or bank holidays, in which case salary is credited on the preceding working day. The payroll includes basic salary, allowances (HRA, transport, medical, special allowances), performance incentives, and statutory components. Deductions are applied for Provident Fund (PF) - 12% of basic salary (employee contribution), Employee State Insurance (ESI) - if applicable based on salary threshold, Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) as per Income Tax Act, Professional Tax (state-specific), and any unpaid leave or advance recoveries. The Cost to Company (CTC) structure is detailed in the offer letter, and employees can view their complete salary breakdown, payslips, Form 16, and deduction statements through the HRMS/payroll portal. Payslips are typically available by the 5th of each month. For payroll queries, discrepancies, or tax-related questions, employees can contact the HR/Payroll team via email or raise a ticket through the helpdesk portal.

The holiday list includes National Holidays (Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti), Regional/Festival Holidays (Diwali, Holi, Eid, Christmas, regional festivals based on location), and Company-Specific Holidays.

Employees working on official holidays or weekly-offs are eligible for Compensatory Off (Comp Off) or overtime compensation as per company policy and manager approval.
